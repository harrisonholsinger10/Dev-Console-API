# Dev-Console-API

This is an internal tool used by QA to test virtual appointments more efficiently. This API autmatically inserts a patient into the master database and then checks that patient into their virtual appointment by inserting he or she into the check-in database. It consolidates a 15 minute manual process into a single API call.
